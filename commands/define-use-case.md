description: Create a new use case document

# Instructions

I want to build the $1 use case. Let's do a discovery interview to figure out
exactly what I'm building. Act as a product manager and interview me about:

1. What problem am I solving?
2. Who are the users?
3. What are the core features?
4. What's the scope (MVP vs full)?
5. What are the success criteria?

Ask me questions one at a time. Challenge my assumptions. Help me think through
edge cases I might be missing. Once we've covered everything, create the use case document in the /docs/use-cases folder underneath the correct epic sub-folder using the /docs/use-cases/use-case-template.md as your template. Name the use case consistent with the existing use cases and make sure to update the /docs/use-case-index.md file with links to the new document.

Remember to:

- Ask clarifying questions with lettered options
- Keep user stories small (completable in one session)
- Make acceptance criteria specific and verifiable
- Include "Typecheck passes" on every story
- Include "Verify in browser" on UI stories
