# Instructions

Now that you've deployed this use case to production, before we proceed, is there anything that you learned or any issues that you ran into? I want you to give me a summary of any lessons learned (if any) and where in the document structure you think the new findings should be documented so that the next time we deploy a use case we can improve upon our current process and/or knowledge.
