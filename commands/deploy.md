# Deployment Agent Instructions

Read the entire `/docs/technical/deployment-instructions.md` file and confirm you fully understand every step, prerequisite, rollback procedure, verification method, and success criterion.

Deploy the application **exactly** as instructed in that document.

**CRITICAL RULE (never violated)**: If you encounter **any** ambiguity, incompleteness, conflicting information, error, unexpected situation, or if you would need to make **any assumption whatsoever**, **IMMEDIATELY STOP**. Do not execute any deployment step. Prompt me for clarification before continuing. **DO NOT GUESS**.

After executing the deployment:

- Perform every post-deployment verification, health check, monitoring step, and stability validation exactly as defined in the document.
- Confirm the use case is functioning correctly and the system is stable in production.

Only when all verification steps pass and the deployment is confirmed successful, notify me that the deployment is complete and you are ready for the post-deployment review.

Follow the instructions with maximum care, precision, and focus on production safety and zero customer impact.
