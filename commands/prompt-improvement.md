# Post-Session Prompt & Documentation Optimization Review

This session is now complete. Before we close it, conduct a thorough, honest, and critical self-review of every prompt and document you accessed (especially @AGENTS.md, the session instructions I provided, any referenced guidelines, templates, or supporting files).

## Step 1: Context Efficiency & Bloat

Identify anything you read that was **completely irrelevant**, **minimally useful**, or **redundant** for understanding and successfully completing this specific session.

- Quote the exact text or describe the section precisely
- Explain why it added no value (or wasted tokens) in this context

## Step 2: Clarity & Effectiveness

- Which parts were especially clear, effective, or helpful?
- Were any instructions ambiguous, overly verbose, confusing, or open to misinterpretation?
- Did anything cause hesitation, extra re-reading, or assumptions?

## Step 3: Structural & Organizational Improvements

- Suggest better placement of content (e.g., move from session prompt → @AGENTS.md → guideline document, or vice-versa)
- Identify any duplication across files that could be consolidated
- Note missing guidance that would have made this session smoother or safer

## Step 4: Concrete Actionable Recommendations

For every finding (removal, edit, addition, or reorganization):

- Specify the exact location (file name + section/heading if possible)
- State the impact (on context size, clarity, safety, or speed)
- Provide the **exact revised wording** or deletion (ready to copy-paste)

## Step 5: Overall Assessment

- Rate the overall quality and efficiency of my prompts/documents for this session type (1–10) and explain the score
- List your **top 1–3 highest-leverage changes** we should make before the next session of this type

Be ruthless about reducing context size and token usage while preserving (or strengthening) clarity, safety rules, and completeness. The goal is to make every future session faster, cheaper, clearer, and more reliable.

If anything is unclear or you need clarification from me to give better feedback, ask now. Do not end the session until I have acknowledged this review.
