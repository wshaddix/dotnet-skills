# dotnet-github-docs

GitHub-native documentation patterns for .NET projects: README structure with NuGet/CI/coverage badges and installation instructions, CONTRIBUTING.md with fork-PR workflow and development setup, issue templates (bug report with .NET version and repro steps, feature request with problem/solution/alternatives), PR templates with testing checklist and breaking changes section, GitHub Pages setup for documentation sites, repository metadata (CODEOWNERS, FUNDING.yml, social preview, topics/tags), and Mermaid diagram embedding in README files.

**Version assumptions:** .NET 8.0+ baseline for code examples. GitHub Actions for CI badges. NuGet.org for package badges.

**Scope boundary:** This skill owns GitHub-native documentation structure and templates for .NET projects -- the files that live in a repository root and `.github/` directory. CI/CD deployment pipelines for GitHub Pages sites are owned by [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy]. Changelog generation and versioning conventions are owned by [skill:dotnet-release-management]. Documentation tooling selection (Starlight, Docusaurus, DocFX) is owned by [skill:dotnet-documentation-strategy]. Mermaid diagram syntax and .NET-specific diagram patterns are owned by [skill:dotnet-mermaid-diagrams].

**Out of scope:** CI/CD deployment workflows for GitHub Pages or doc sites -- see [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy]. Changelog generation and release versioning -- see [skill:dotnet-release-management]. Documentation platform selection and configuration -- see [skill:dotnet-documentation-strategy]. Mermaid diagram syntax details -- see [skill:dotnet-mermaid-diagrams]. Project file structure and solution organization -- see [skill:dotnet-project-structure].

Cross-references: [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy] for GitHub Pages deployment pipelines, [skill:dotnet-release-management] for changelog format and versioning, [skill:dotnet-mermaid-diagrams] for .NET-specific Mermaid diagrams in READMEs, [skill:dotnet-project-structure] for project metadata context, [skill:dotnet-documentation-strategy] for doc platform selection.

## README Structure for .NET Projects

A well-structured README provides immediate context for contributors and consumers of a .NET project.

### Badges

Place badges at the top of the README, grouped by category:

```markdown
# My.Library

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/My.Library.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/My.Library)
[![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/My.Library.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/My.Library)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/mycompany/my-library/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mycompany/my-library/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mycompany/my-library/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mycompany/my-library)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
```

**Badge categories for .NET projects:**

| Badge | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| NuGet version | shields.io + nuget.org | Use package ID, not assembly name |
| NuGet downloads | shields.io + nuget.org | Shows adoption; use `dt` for total downloads |

### Architecture Diagram in README

Embed a Mermaid architecture diagram directly in the README for visual context. GitHub renders Mermaid fenced code blocks natively:

````markdown
## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Client
        App["Consumer App"]
    end
    subgraph Library["My.Library"]
        API["Public API Surface"]
        Core["Core Engine"]
        Cache["In-Memory Cache"]
    end
    App --> API
    API --> Core
    Core --> Cache
```
````

See [skill:dotnet-mermaid-diagrams] for .NET-specific diagram patterns including C4-style architecture, sequence diagrams for API flows, and class diagrams for domain models.

## GitHub Pages Setup

GitHub Pages can host documentation sites generated by Starlight, Docusaurus, or DocFX. This section covers the repository configuration; CI deployment pipeline configuration belongs to [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy].

### Repository Settings

1. Navigate to **Settings > Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (not the legacy branch-based deployment)
3. The deployment workflow in `.github/workflows/` handles the build and publish steps

### Doc Site Directory Structure

Place documentation source files in a `docs/` directory at the repository root:

```
my-library/
  src/
    MyLibrary/
      MyLibrary.csproj
  docs/
    astro.config.mjs          # For Starlight
    # OR docusaurus.config.js  # For Docusaurus
    # OR docfx.json            # For DocFX
  .github/
    workflows/
      deploy-docs.yml          # Deployment workflow -- see [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy]
  README.md
  CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Custom Domain

Configure a custom domain for GitHub Pages:

1. Add a `CNAME` file in the doc site's static directory (e.g., `docs/public/CNAME` for Starlight, `docs/static/CNAME` for Docusaurus)
2. Set the domain in **Settings > Pages > Custom domain**
3. Enable **Enforce HTTPS**

Content in the `CNAME` file:

```
docs.mylibrary.dev
```

For documentation platform selection and configuration, see [skill:dotnet-documentation-strategy]. For deployment workflow YAML, see [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy].

## Repository Metadata

### CODEOWNERS

Define code ownership for automated review assignment:

```
# .github/CODEOWNERS

# Default owner for everything
* @mycompany/core-team

# Documentation
/docs/ @mycompany/docs-team
*.md @mycompany/docs-team

# Source code by area
/src/MyLibrary.Core/ @mycompany/core-team
/src/MyLibrary.Data/ @mycompany/data-team

# Build and CI
/.github/ @mycompany/devops-team
/build/ @mycompany/devops-team
*.props @mycompany/core-team
*.targets @mycompany/core-team

# NuGet configuration
nuget.config @mycompany/core-team
Directory.Packages.props @mycompany/core-team
```

### FUNDING.yml

Configure GitHub Sponsors and other funding links:

```yaml
# .github/FUNDING.yml
github: [maintainer-username]
open_collective: my-library
custom: ["https://www.buymeacoffee.com/maintainer"]
```

### Social Preview

- Navigate to **Settings > General > Social preview**
- Upload a 1280x640 image (2:1 aspect ratio)
- Include: project name, logo, brief tagline, and .NET version badge
- Use a consistent brand color scheme

### Topics and Tags

Add repository topics for discoverability:

- `dotnet`, `csharp`, `nuget` -- ecosystem tags
- `library`, `sdk`, `framework` -- project type
- `aspnetcore`, `efcore`, `blazor` -- technology-specific tags
- Descriptive tags: `serialization`, `logging`, `dependency-injection`, etc.

Set topics in **Settings > General > Topics** or via the repository description area on the main page.

### Repository Description

Keep the repository description concise (under 350 characters). Include:
- What the project does
- Key differentiator or primary use case
- Target .NET version if relevant

Example: "High-performance JSON serialization library for .NET 8+ with source generator support and AOT compatibility."

## Agent Gotchas

1. **Always use YAML-based issue templates (`.yml`), not Markdown templates (`.md`)** -- YAML templates provide structured form fields with validation, dropdowns, and required fields. Markdown templates are the legacy format and offer no input validation.

2. **The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory must contain a `config.yml`** -- without it, the "blank issue" option appears by default. Set `blank_issues_enabled: false` to force users through templates.

3. **Badge URLs must use the correct NuGet package ID** -- the package ID is case-sensitive on shields.io. Use the exact ID from NuGet.org (e.g., `Newtonsoft.Json`, not `newtonsoft.json`).

4. **CODEOWNERS patterns follow `.gitignore` syntax** -- use `/src/` for root-relative paths. Without the leading `/`, the pattern matches anywhere in the tree.

5. **GitHub Pages source must be set to "GitHub Actions"** -- the legacy "Deploy from a branch" mode does not support custom build steps. The GitHub Actions source delegates build and deployment to a workflow. For the workflow YAML, see [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy].

6. **Do not generate CI/CD deployment YAML in this skill** -- deployment workflows for GitHub Pages belong to [skill:dotnet-gha-deploy]. This skill covers repository structure and template content only.

7. **Do not generate changelog content** -- changelog format, versioning strategy, and release notes belong to [skill:dotnet-release-management]. Reference CHANGELOG.md in the README but do not define its format here.

8. **PR template file must be named exactly `pull_request_template.md`** -- GitHub only recognizes this exact filename (case-insensitive). It can live in the root, `docs/`, or `.github/` directory. The `.github/` location is recommended for consistency with issue templates.

9. **Include `.NET Version` in bug report templates** -- .NET version is critical for reproducing bugs. Use `dotnet --version` output as the expected format. Include OS as a dropdown since behavior often varies across platforms.

10. **Mermaid diagrams in README render natively on GitHub** -- no special configuration is needed. Use standard fenced code blocks with the `mermaid` language identifier. See [skill:dotnet-mermaid-diagrams] for .NET-specific diagram patterns to embed in architecture sections.
